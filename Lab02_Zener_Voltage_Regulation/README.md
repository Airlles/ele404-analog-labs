# Lab 02 – Zener Voltage Regulation

This lab explored three basic types of voltage regulation circuits:
1. **Resistive voltage divider**
2. **Zener diode regulator**
3. **Diode-based regulator**

Each circuit was tested under varying load conditions to evaluate output voltage stability, percent error, and regulation quality.

### Key Objectives
- Understand how different voltage regulator circuits respond to load current variations
- Compare theoretical vs. experimental output voltages
- Analyze the trade-offs between resistive, Zener, and diode-based regulation

### Skills Demonstrated
- Breadboard implementation of regulator circuits
- Voltage vs. load current data collection and plotting
- Calculation of percent error and load resistance
- Interpretation of load regulation curves and performance

### Tools Used
- Breadboard  
- DC Power Supply  
- Multimeter  
- Zener Diodes (e.g., 1N4733)  
- Standard Diodes (e.g., 1N4148)  
- Resistors, Potentiometer
