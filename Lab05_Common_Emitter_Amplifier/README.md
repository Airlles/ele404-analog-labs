# Lab 05 – Common-Emitter BJT Amplifier

This lab focused on building and analyzing a common-emitter (CE) amplifier using a 2N3904 NPN BJT. The goal was to study amplifier gain, input/output resistance, and the effects of load variation on output signal performance.

The experiment included:
1. Measuring DC voltages at the base, collector, and emitter
2. Calculating Ic, Ib, and Ie to confirm transistor operation in active mode
3. Building a full CE amplifier with capacitive coupling and load resistor
4. Measuring gain (Av) in both RMS and decibels with and without load
5. Assessing amplifier input/output resistance with test resistor configurations

### Key Objectives
- Understand transistor biasing and gain characteristics in a CE amplifier
- Measure input and output voltages to evaluate gain under load and no-load
- Experimentally calculate input/output resistance using known test resistors
- Observe waveform distortion and amplifier linearity limitations
