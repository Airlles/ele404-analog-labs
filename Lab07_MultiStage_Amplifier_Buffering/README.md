# Lab 07 – Multi-Stage BJT Amplifier with Buffering

This lab involved constructing and analyzing a two-stage BJT amplifier consisting of a Common-Emitter (CE) stage followed by a Common-Collector (CC) stage. The experiment focused on evaluating the buffering effect of the CC stage and analyzing voltage gain across various load conditions.

The circuit was tested in three configurations:
1. CE amplifier only with a load
2. CE amplifier connected to CC stage (buffer), without load
3. Full CE + CC amplifier with load attached

### Key Objectives
- Understand the role of a Common-Collector stage as a buffer
- Measure and compare voltage gain (Av) across three amplifier configurations
- Analyze how the CC stage minimizes loading effects on the CE stage
- Estimate input and output resistance variations across stages

### Skills Demonstrated
- Multi-stage analog amplifier design and testing
- Voltage gain measurement in dB and RMS across configurations
- Signal analysis with and without buffering
- Theoretical vs. experimental comparison of gain and impedance behavior

### Tools Used
- Breadboard  
- Oscilloscope  
- Multimeter  
- Function Generator  
- 2× 2N3904 NPN Transistors  
- Resistors, Capacitors
