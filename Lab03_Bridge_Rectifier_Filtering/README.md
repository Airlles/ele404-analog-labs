# Lab 03 – Bridge Rectifier with Capacitive Filtering

This lab examined how a full-wave bridge rectifier converts AC to DC, and how the addition of a capacitor reduces voltage ripple in the output.

Two configurations were tested:
- A basic bridge rectifier with a resistive load
- A filtered version using a capacitor in parallel with the load

### Key Objectives
- Understand how a bridge rectifier functions using four diodes
- Measure and compare DC output voltage and ripple voltage with and without filtering
- Analyze how capacitor selection affects ripple suppression and load response
- Evaluate error between theoretical and measured ripple values

### Skills Demonstrated
- Constructing full-wave rectifier circuits on a breadboard
- Using oscilloscopes to capture and compare voltage waveforms
- Measuring ripple voltage and calculating DC output accuracy
- Debugging capacitor polarity and voltage drop behavior

### Tools Used
- Breadboard  
- Function Generator  
- Oscilloscope  
- Multimeter  
- Electrolytic Capacitors  
- 1N4148 Diodes  
- Load Resistors
