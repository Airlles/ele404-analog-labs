# Lab 06 – Common-Base BJT Amplifier

This lab focused on constructing and analyzing a Common-Base (CB) amplifier using a 2N3904 NPN BJT. Unlike the Common-Emitter configuration, the CB amplifier provides low input resistance and is often used for high-frequency applications due to its superior bandwidth characteristics.

The experiment included:
1. Building the CB amplifier using voltage divider biasing and capacitive coupling
2. Measuring input and output voltages in both RMS and dB
3. Comparing gain performance with and without load
4. Inserting a test resistor (Rt,in) at the input to estimate input resistance
5. Replacing the load with a test resistor (Rt,out) to determine output resistance

### Key Objectives
- Understand biasing and operation of the Common-Base amplifier
- Evaluate gain and input/output resistance characteristics
- Compare CB amplifier behavior with previously tested CE amplifier
- Observe waveform response and loading effects

### Skills Demonstrated
- Low input impedance circuit construction and measurement
- Waveform acquisition and gain comparison using oscilloscope and multimeter
- Input/output resistance analysis through voltage division techniques
- Analog amplifier performance comparison (CB vs CE)

### Tools Used
- Breadboard  
- Oscilloscope  
- Multimeter  
- Function Generator  
- 2N3904 NPN Transistor  
- Resistors, Capacitors
