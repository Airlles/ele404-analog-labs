# Lab 01 – 1N4148 Diode Characterization

This lab investigates the forward-bias V-I characteristics and small-signal behavior of a 1N4148 silicon diode.

Two configurations were tested:
- A series diode-resistor circuit
- A parallel resistor-diode configuration

### Skills Demonstrated
- Breadboard circuit building
- Oscilloscope + multimeter measurement
- Waveform capture and analysis
- Debugging contact resistance errors at low current

**Tools Used:** Breadboard, Oscilloscope, DC Power Supply, Multimeter  
**Course:** ELE404 – Electronics I
