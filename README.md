# ELE404 – Analog Circuit Labs (TMU)

This repository contains original lab reports completed for **ELE404 – Electronics I** at **Toronto Metropolitan University**. Each lab explores a different analog circuit or signal behavior topic, ranging from diodes and rectifiers to BJT amplifiers and waveform shaping.

🧪 **Topics covered include:**
- Diode V-I characterization
- Zener voltage regulation
- Full-wave bridge rectification
- Diode waveform shaping
- Common-emitter, common-base, and common-collector BJT amplifiers
- Multi-stage amplifier buffering and gain analysis

📁 **Each lab is organized into its own folder:**
- Lab reports are in PDF format
- Each folder contains a summary `README.md` explaining the lab’s objective, key concepts, skills demonstrated, and tools used
