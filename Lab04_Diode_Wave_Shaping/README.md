# Lab 04 – Diode Waveform Shaping Circuit

This lab explored the use of diodes and voltage divider networks to manipulate input waveforms. The circuit leveraged the non-linear characteristics of diodes to limit and reshape a symmetrical triangular input signal.

Three versions of the wave-shaping circuit were built:
1. Standard diode network with fixed resistors
2. Same circuit with resistor values increased by a factor of 10
3. Circuit with bypass capacitors added to investigate filtering effects

### Key Objectives
- Understand the role of diodes in signal shaping and clipping
- Analyze how resistor scaling affects the waveform shape
- Explore the influence of bypass capacitors on waveform response
- Compare theoretical transfer characteristics with actual oscilloscope waveforms

### Skills Demonstrated
- Constructing complex diode-resistor circuits for waveform shaping
- Measuring and comparing Vi vs Vo characteristics across variations
- Interpreting oscilloscope data to identify clamping and limiting behavior
- Evaluating circuit non-linearity introduced by diode conduction thresholds

### Tools Used
- Breadboard  
- Function Generator  
- Oscilloscope  
- 1N4148 Diodes  
- Electrolytic Capacitors  
- Resistors (standard and scaled)
